# Poke'mon, the Table Top Role Playing Game

### What is this?

_Poke'mon, the Table Top Role Playing Game_ is a fan adaptation of the Poke'mon franchise to a table top role laying game format. From the Poke'mon franchise, we were most inspired by the Poke'mon Coleuseum games, the early seasons on the anime, and the Poke'mon Adventures manga.

### Who is this game best suited for?

Anyone familiar with Dungeons and Dragons fourth or fifth editions will find this an easy rule set to learn. We've incorporated the action economy from fifth edition, with its focus on standard, bonus, and reaction actions. From fourth edition we've taken a focus on a tight squad combat experience.

This ruleset has a fair amount of lift and shift from the mechanics of the Poke'mon video games, and we have not yet converted everything from the games. A familiarity with the mechanics of the mainline Poke'mon video games will help.

### How Many Players Is This Game For?

This game supports two to four players, one as the *Game Master* and the other one to three as *Poke'mon Trainers*.

### What physical stuff is needed to play

1. Dice
    a. a d20
    b. many many d10s
    c. a d6
2. A Hex marked battle map
3. Tokens or markers to represent Poke'mon and trainers on the hex grid
4. Pencil and Paper
5. A guidebook for one of the mainline Poke'mon video games, preferably one that rates the Poke'mon's stats on a scale of 1 to 5

### What kind of play experience does this rule set support?

This rule set only provides rules for battling Poke'mon. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons, there are no rules for resolving events or driving the story outside of the battles. Outside of combat, this makes for a more free form role play than most Dungeons and Dragons players are accustomed to. My advice is, whatever action a trainer or their Poke'mon could reasonably accomplish and would help drive the story, the Game Master should let them.

The battle mechanics are best suited for battles that are at least two Poke'mon against two Poke'mon. Having multiple Poke'mon on each side of a battle is the easist way to produce a tight squad combat experiece. The mechanics can do one on one battles however, if needed. The battle mechanics are flexible and can support unconvetional battle scenarios, such as:

1. One extremely tough Poke'mon facing off a half dozen weaker Poke'mon
2. A three way battle, each team fielding multiple Poke'mon
3.

The Poke'mon trainers are combatants in battles same as their Poke'mon. In an honorable Gym battle, attacking the trainers is against the rules of sportsmanship, but in a street fight or battle against Team Rocket, anything could go. One human player will manage multiple tokens on the hex battle map, playing both their Trainer and their Trainer's Poke'mon.

We have ported a fraction of the video game Poke'mon content to this rule set. Be prepared to do more homebrewing than you are probably accustomed to playing Dungeons and Dragons or other table top role playing games. Do not worry though, e have guidelines to help you.

### How can I get started playing?

Read the rules! We've littered them with Game Master advice and examples.

After reading the rules, look over our two example adventures. The first is a plotless battle against Team Rocket just to illustrate the game mechanics. You can play out that battle yourself, or read through our transcript of playing out that battle.
